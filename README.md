SmartApply: AI-Powered Job Application PlatformSmartApply is a modern web application designed to streamline the job search and application process using AI. It allows users to upload their resumes, extract key skills, find matching job opportunities, and simulate auto-applications, all while tracking their progress through a comprehensive dashboard.‚ú® FeaturesResume Upload & Parsing: Upload your resume (TXT or PDF) and let the AI extract relevant skills.AI-Powered Job Matching: Finds simulated job opportunities based on your extracted skills. (Note: Requires a separate backend scraper for real job data).Auto-Apply Simulation: Simulates applying to jobs, updating application statuses, and providing instant feedback.Application Status Dashboard: A visual dashboard to track applied jobs, jobs under review, and scheduled interviews.Application Calendar: Visualize your job application timeline and upcoming interviews.Resume Analysis & Improvements: Get insights into your resume's strengths and receive suggestions for improvement.ATS Resume Checker: (Simulated) Upload your resume to get an Applicant Tracking System (ATS) compatibility score and breakdown.Resume Conversion & Cover Letter Generation: Tailor your resume for specific companies and generate professional cover letters using AI.Multi-Resume Support: Manage multiple resumes for different job profiles.Notifications & Alerts: Get alerts for new job matches (simulated).Data Export: Export your application data to CSV.User Authentication: Secure user login and signup using Supabase (Email/Password and Google OAuth).üöÄ Technologies UsedFrontend:React (with TypeScript)Tailwind CSS for stylingRecharts for data visualizationReact Calendar for date visualizationReact Toastify for notificationsBackend/Database (External Dependencies):Supabase: Used for user authentication and data persistence (user profiles, applied jobs, settings).Google Gemini API: Used for AI functionalities like skill extraction, resume conversion, and cover letter generation.Job Scraper Backend (External/Simulated): The application expects a local Node.js backend running at http://localhost:3000/scraper/find-jobs to fetch real job data. Without it, the application will use static demo job data.PDF.js: Used for parsing PDF resumes (loaded via CDN).‚öôÔ∏è Setup and InstallationFollow these steps to get SmartApply up and running on your local machine.PrerequisitesNode.js (v18 or higher recommended)npm or Yarn1. Clone the Repositorygit clone <repository-url> # Replace with your repository URL
cd smartapply-frontend # Or whatever your project folder is named
2. Install Frontend Dependenciesnpm install
# or
yarn install
3. Set up SupabaseSmartApply uses Supabase for authentication and storing user data.Create a Supabase Project:Go to Supabase and create a new project.Note down your Project URL and anon public key. These are used in supabaseUrl and supabaseAnonKey in src/App.tsx.Create user_profiles Table:In your Supabase project dashboard, navigate to the "Table editor" and create a new table named user_profiles.Here's the basic SQL schema for the user_profiles table. You can paste this into the SQL Editor in Supabase and run it:CREATE TABLE user_profiles (
  id UUID PRIMARY KEY REFERENCES auth.users(id),
  email TEXT UNIQUE,
  resume_text TEXT,
  skills TEXT[], -- Array of strings
  jobs JSONB, -- JSON array of job objects
  is_auto_applied BOOLEAN DEFAULT FALSE,
  applied_jobs JSONB, -- JSON array of applied job objects
  applied_jobs_count INTEGER DEFAULT 0,
  in_review_jobs_count INTEGER DEFAULT 0,
  interview_scheduled_count INTEGER DEFAULT 0,
  response_rate INTEGER DEFAULT 0,
  success_score NUMERIC DEFAULT 0.0,
  app_performance JSONB, -- JSON object for performance metrics
  auto_apply_threshold INTEGER DEFAULT 80,
  job_types JSONB, -- JSON object for job type preferences
  min_salary INTEGER DEFAULT 0,
  max_salary INTEGER DEFAULT 9999999,
  last_updated TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE DEFAULT NOW()
);

-- Enable Row Level Security (RLS)
ALTER TABLE user_profiles ENABLE ROW LEVEL SECURITY;

-- Policy for users to view and update their own profile
CREATE POLICY "Users can view their own profile."
ON user_profiles FOR SELECT USING (auth.uid() = id);

CREATE POLICY "Users can update their own profile."
ON user_profiles FOR UPDATE USING (auth.uid() = id);

-- Policy for users to insert their own profile on signup
CREATE POLICY "Users can insert their own profile."
ON user_profiles FOR INSERT WITH CHECK (auth.uid() = id);
4. Google Gemini API KeyObtain a Google Gemini API key from the Google AI Studio or Google Cloud Console.Replace "AIzaSyDKJx_nV7s58ig2jw3Biiu1nr5xePTtVCM" with your actual API key in src/App.tsx:const GEMINI_API_KEY = "YOUR_GEMINI_API_KEY_HERE";
Note: For production applications, it's highly recommended to store API keys as environment variables, not directly in the code.5. Job Scraper Backend (Optional but Recommended)The application attempts to fetch real job data from http://localhost:3000/scraper/find-jobs. This requires a separate backend service that can scrape job boards.If you do NOT set up a backend scraper: The application will gracefully fall back to using demoJobs (static data) for job suggestions. The core functionality of skill extraction and auto-apply simulation will still work.If you want real job data: You will need to build and run a Node.js (or Python, etc.) backend that exposes an endpoint at http://localhost:3000/scraper/find-jobs that accepts a POST request with keywords and returns a JSON array of job objects.6. Run the Development Servernpm start
# or
yarn start
This will open the application in your browser, usually at http://localhost:3000.üöÄ UsageHome Page: Upon loading, you'll see the main landing page.Upload Resume: Click "Upload & Auto-Apply" and select a .txt or .pdf resume file.Auto-Apply & Redirect: The application will process your resume, extract skills, and automatically "apply" to simulated jobs. You will then be redirected to the "Application Status" page.Explore Dashboard & Status: Navigate between "Dashboard" and "Application Status" using the navigation bar to see your simulated application progress and statistics.ATS & Resume Convert: Explore the "ATS" and "Resume Convert" sections for additional tools.Login/Signup: Use the "Login" or "Sign Up" buttons in the navigation bar to create an account or sign in. Your data will be persisted with Supabase.ü§ù ContributingContributions are welcome!
